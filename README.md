# Crescendo

Crescendo is a platform for organized music. You can browse artists and songs sorted by a genre, as well as view an artist's page and their albums.  
From here you're able to add an artist or album to your personal library, or even create a playlist of songs for your library.  

Crescendo centralizes your musical interests so you can easily find what you want to listen to based on your sorting.  

(Roughly a spotify clone without user feedback or social aspects)
