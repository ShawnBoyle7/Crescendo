# Crescendo

Crescendo is a WIP spotify clone platform for organized music. 
You can browse artists and songs sorted by a genre, as well as view an artist's page and their albums.
From here you're able to add an artist or album to your personal library, or even create a playlist of songs for your library.
If you like, you can just view all the artists or songs, go to a particular song and press play! 

Crescendo centralizes your musical interests so you can easily find what you want to listen to based on your sorting.
